# Analysis of effectiveness of denoising autoencoder vs DBN
This project aims to compare DBN with autoencoders when dealing with noisy data (in this case images).  
The project is tested over the MNIST Digits dataset.

### How to run
Clone the repository, and if you don't want to train your model by your own, copy the files from the `models` folder on the main folder (supposing you have your terminal on the cloned folder, `cp ./models/* ./`)
